# PebbleKit iOS

Welcome to Pebble's official iOS SDK!

## Compatibility

- iOS 5.0+
- iPhone 3GS or later

## Sports & Golf Demo Projects

Have a look at the included sample project _SportsDemo_ and _GolfDemo_.
This project shows how to use the sports and golf APIs of PebbleKit.
These APIs are built on top of AppMessage.

## Weather Demo Project

Also, look at the sample project _WeatherDemo_, which is the companion app of the Weather watch application that is included in the native watch app SDK (see folder `feature_app_messages/` in the native SDK package).
This example defines a custom AppMessage to send weather data from the phone to the watch.

## Integrating PebbleKit

- Drag PebbleKit.framework into project
- Drag in PebbleVendor.framework into the project, or, drag the PebbleVendor.xcodeproj into project if you need to control the 3rd party components needed for PebbleKit.
- Link ExternalAccessory.framework, libz.dylib, CoreBluetooth.framework, CoreMotion.framework and MessageUI.framework
- Add "-ObjC" linker flag to your project's build settings
- Add the value "com.getpebble.public" to the "Supported external accessory protocols" (UISupportedExternalAccessoryProtocols) array in your app's Info.plist
- Optionally, add the value "App communicates with an accessory" (external-accessory) to the "Required background modes" (UIBackgroundModes) array in your app's Info.plist


## Xcode Documentation

- An Xcode docset is included with documentation about all public APIs.
- Copy `com.getpebble.PebbleKit.docset` content into `~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets`
- Restart Xcode. The documentation will now be available from `Help > Documentation and API Reference`

## Submitting iOS apps with PebbleKit to Apple's App Store

In order for Pebble to work with iPhones, Pebble is part of the Made For iPhone program (a requirement for hardware accessories to interact with iOS apps). Unfortunately this also means that if you build an iOS app with PebbleKit, we (Pebble) will need to whitelist your iOS app before you can upload it to the App Store. If you have completed a Pebble app and would like to learn more about making it available on the App Store, please email [bizdev@getpebble.com](mailto:bizdev@getpebble.com)
